This isn't necessarily a full list of changes. Noteworthy behavior of new features will be listed here.

v0.2.0
- Add the ability for multiple (2) character to appear at once.
	- The editor (intentionally) won't allow you to set the same character for both characters.
	- With this you now must set which character "owns" the dialogue (i.e. who is talking).
		- For convenience the label in the editor is called "Talking:"
		- If you go from having no characters in the dialogue (and therefore no owner), setting a character will make that character the owner.
